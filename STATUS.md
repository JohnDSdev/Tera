# Repository Status Notes

The "Create Gemini voice conversation interface" work currently lives on the local `work` branch in this development environment. The repository does not have a remote configured, so nothing has been pushed to GitHub yet. To see the changes on GitHub, add the appropriate remote and push the branch.
